DRPodcastShell is a PowerShell module that let's you get Podcast details from DR Lyd, and generate Podcast/RSS feeds for the shows, as well as a HTML page for the scraped shows.

The reason for this module is that DR decided to delay publishing some shows, and completely remove others, from third party Podcast players, forcing you to use their DR Lyd app, rather than your preferred Podcast app.
